            Thanks to the vision of the late Edward "Skip" Masland '49, the Peddie Sports Hall of Fame has been able to preserve the lore and legacy of Peddie's finest athletes, teams and coaches.

        <h3>
            Since 1986, teams, individual athletes, dedicated coaches and some special individuals dedicated to the mission of athletics at Peddie have been inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame. Their stories give us a snapshot of what Peddie athletics was like in their day and lay the foundation for current and future student-athletes to pursue their dreams and make their own mark on an already distinguished past.
